# Project Description

Welcome to my Final Year Project! This repository showcases my work in the field of image captioning. I employed state-of-the-art technology, using the Visual Transformer (ViT) as the encoder and the BERT Transformer as the decoder. Our goal was to generate high-quality image captions.

## Dataset
To evaluate our approach, we used the widely recognized Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset. You can access the dataset on Kaggle via the following link: [COCO Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/coco-2017-dataset). COCO provides a rich resource of annotated images for object detection, segmentation, and captioning.

Feel free to explore the code and project details in this repository to learn more about our image captioning research. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!
